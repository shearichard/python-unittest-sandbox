# Python Unittest Sandbox
This project is used to demonstrate how the Python unittest module may be used.

Tested against Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 20.x

## Invoking tests

There are two modules of interest. One outputs messages to indicate the order in which different elements of a unittest based module execute. This may be invoked as follows.
```
python -m module_framework_illustrator
```

A more realistic illustration how tests are structured exists in `module.py` and may be invoked as follows.

```
python -m module
```
